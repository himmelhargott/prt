This is a MVP for the no yet finally named ProjectRoundTable.

It is live on: https://indigo-christie-10.tiiny.site/

to test it:

1.
    install hiro wallet browser extension (if you havent installed it yet just click on the connect button and you will be guided through the process)

2.
    once you have your wallet, get some testnet STX: https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/deploy?chain=testnet

    click on "Sandbox"
    click button "Connect Stacks Wallet"
    go to "Testnet faucet" (the butten on the left shaped like a water drop)
    click button "Request STX" there is a message: ðŸ’°STX coming your way shortly!ðŸ’° you will have to wait approx. 20min until the STX arrive in your wallet.

3.
    as soon as you have the Testnet STX you are ready to go. Enjoy =)
